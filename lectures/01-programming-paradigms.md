Philosophy of Grading
---------------------

- I want everyone to succeed
- Grades are one tool that I have to motivate you
    - Blunt tool
    - Prefer intrinsic motivation

Programming Paradigms
=====================

CPSC 2020
---------

- Introduction to Computational Thinking
- What was your experience like? 
- What was exciting? Confusing? Challenging?

CPSC 2030
---------

- Object-Oriented Analysis and Design
- Additional exposure to learning a language (Python)
- Provide an initial introduction to a new language (C++)
- Grow your “programming toolkit”

Computer
--------

The modern digital electronic computer is a stored program computer based on von Neumann architecture

![Von Neumann Architecture](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e5/Von_Neumann_Architecture.svg/640px-Von_Neumann_Architecture.svg.png)

von Neumann architecture
------------------------

- Input: Mouse, Keyboard, Programs
- CPU
- Memory
  - Short-Term: RAM (“Random Access”)
  - Long-Term: HDD
-  Output
  - GUI (Graphical User Interface)

Programming Language
--------------------

- Draws on automata theory→ deep dive in theory of machines and computation
- Turing Machine
  - Infinite Tape with “cells” containing a computational head that can read/write
  - Machine contains a finite table of potential “states”
- Turing Complete: Given infinite time and memory, able to solve all possible problems

Turing Completeness
-------------------

- C++, Javascript, Python are Turing complete languages
- HTML/CSS are not generally used this way because they focus on structure/formatting of web pages

Execution
---------

- Instructions are ultimately given to the CPU (and to other hardware) in machine language–which is binary (ones and zeros)
- Assembly languages provide “human-readable” low-level language for hardware instructions

Interpreter
----------

- Intermediary program executes code to produce output
- Machine code may not be directly generated by this program

Paradigms
---------

- Imperative/Procedural
  - Assignment and Iteration
  - C, Fortran, and other OO Languages
- Object-Oriented 
  - Uses objects to encapsulate data and behavior
  - C#, C++, Java, Python, Javascript

Paradigms
---------

- Declarative 
  - SQL, HTML
- Functional 
  - ML, Haskell
- Logic 
  - Prolog

Multi-paradigm
--------------

- Most modern languages fit in more than on category

Syntax
------

- Establishes the form and structure of the language
- Use of tab/whitespace, semicolons, brackets, special symbols such as “++”, etc.

Semantics
---------

- Semantics deals with the behavior and meaning of the languages
- What does a given expression do? How does a function work?
