Iterative Process

3. Implementation - Build the solution

Four Principles of OOP
----------------------

Encapsulation
  ~ Combine data, methods, and interfaces

Inheritance
  ~ Share members between classes

Polymorphism
  ~ Share interfaces between types

Abstraction
  ~ Hide complexity behind clean interface

How does encapsulating data and behavior into objects improve code organization and maintainability?
